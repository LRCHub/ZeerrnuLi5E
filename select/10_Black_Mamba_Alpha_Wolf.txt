Everybody wants to talk but they never listen
Blank faces seeing every fucking thing through tunnel vision
You turned your back, your skin like ice
Head down
Eyes shut
Blood breath
Suffocation
Never to the eye
I will never lie
These scars paint a picture that I'm forced to hide
I will never, I will never
How many nights spent in collapse collecting the knives you left in my back
I'll cauterise the woulds with every inch of vomit you called a promise
But fuck that, it's not enough, it never will be
No guilt but your hands are still dirty
I'd lie on a rusty bed of nails and you'd still walk over me
You're the deadweight constricting my chest
Only the lonely will hold me like this
Fuck your mind games
I don't play safe
And I will see this through
So motherfucker look at me when I'm talking to you.
Coward
It's time to shake the rust off these chains
Buried resent in your face
Tear apart the walls
Dismantle the frame
Neglect, but you will remember my name
How many times do I have to cry out before this is felt?
How many times did I stand by your fucking side?
Not enough
Never was
Never will be
You abandoned me
You're the deadweight constricting my chest
Only the lonely will hold me like this
Fuck your mind games
I don't play safe
And I will see this through
So motherfucker look at me when I'm talking to you.
